## Project Summary
-------------------

<p>This project involves the operationalization of a House price prediction API developed by our Data science team. The model uses a sklearn model 
that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios etc. 
The application has been designed to run in a kubernetes environment to take advantage of auto scaling and improve uptime and stability of the application.</p>

<br>

## How to run
-------------------

To run the application directly, you can run app.py file directly like so. The API should be exposed on port 80 by default.

```
> python3 app.py
```

The application has been bundled into a docker image which can be downloaded from dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/theanalyst6/house-prediction-ml).

```
> docker pull theanalyst6/house-prediction-ml:v1.0
```

You can then run the container like so, exposing the container on port 8001 on the host.

```
> docker run -d --rm -p 8001:80 --name house-pred-1 theanalyst6/house-prediction-ml:v1.0
```
